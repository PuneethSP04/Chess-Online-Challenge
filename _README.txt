To test different board setups, simply click on the 'Standard', 'Dispersed 1', 'Dispersed 2', or 'Dispersed 3' buttons in the game view.
Each button will clear the board and place the pieces according to the selected test case scenario.

This project was created using Unity Editor version 2020.3.40f1.
